# To-Do List
Here is the short description about how the task is implemented:

1. Jetpack compose is used for completing the UI part
2. Dagger Hilt Dependency Injection Used for injecting dependencies
3. Google recommended MVVM architectural pattern used.
4. Retrofit used for networking activities.
5. Room persistance library is used for saving data locally
6. Sample test cases (database and viewModel) are written in Unit test section

Please Note:
1. Didn't give enough concentration in UI part to look the app better, just basic views were implemented.
2. When the app runs for the first time and no internet available it will show an error screen
3. After a successfull load the data kept in local db and shows every tie afterwards even if the network is not accessible.

THANKS
